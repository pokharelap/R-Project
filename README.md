**Data Analysis in R**

**Task 1: Data Preparation**
- Loaded the necessary R libraries, including ggplot2 for data visualization.
- Read the dataset from an Excel file, which contained information about states and various health insurance-related variables.

**Task 2: Data Cleaning**
- Converted percentage values in the dataset to numeric values to work with percentages as decimals.

**Task 3: Scatter Plot Analysis**
- Created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between "Employer Health Insurance Coverage (2015)" and "Marketplace Health Insurance Coverage (2016)."
- Added bubble sizes to represent "Marketplace Tax Credits (2016)" for each state.
- Set custom axis limits for better visualization.
- Added a linear regression line (red) to show the best-fit line.
- Calculated and displayed the R-squared value to assess the goodness of fit.
- Provided an analysis of the scatter plot, noting the lack of a strong linear relationship between the variables.

**Task 4: Bar Graph Visualization**
- Created a bar graph to compare "Uninsured Rate (2010)" and "Uninsured Rate (2015)" for each state.
- Used different colors to distinguish between the two years.
- Set custom axis labels and a title for clarity.
- Added annotations to the graph to provide context and analysis.

**Overall Analysis:**
- The tasks involved using R for data analysis and visualization.
- A scatter plot was used to assess the relationship between two health insurance-related variables, indicating a weak correlation.
- A bar graph effectively compared uninsured rates for different years and states.
- Visual representations and annotations were provided to assist data scientists and analysts in interpreting the findings.

These tasks helped in exploring and visualizing health insurance data, enabling data-driven insights and analysis for healthcare professionals and policymakers.
